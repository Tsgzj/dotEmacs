Read a string in the minibuffer, with helm completion.

It is helm `completing-read' equivalent.

- PROMPT is the prompt name to use.

- COLLECTION can be a list, vector, obarray or hash-table.
  It can be also a function that receives three arguments:
  the values string, predicate and t. See `all-completions' for more details.

Keys description:

- TEST: A predicate called with one arg i.e candidate.

- INITIAL-INPUT: Same as input arg in `helm'.

- PRESELECT: See preselect arg of `helm'.

- DEFAULT: This option is used only for compatibility with regular
  Emacs `completing-read' (Same as DEFAULT arg of `completing-read').

- BUFFER: Name of helm-buffer.

- MUST-MATCH: Candidate selected must be one of COLLECTION.

- REVERSE-HISTORY: When non--nil display history source after current
  source completion.

- REQUIRES-PATTERN: Same as helm attribute, default is 0.

- HISTORY: A list containing specific history, default is nil.
  When it is non--nil, all elements of HISTORY are displayed in
  a special source before COLLECTION.

- INPUT-HISTORY: A symbol. the minibuffer input history will be
  stored there, if nil or not provided, `minibuffer-history'
  will be used instead.

- CASE-FOLD: Same as `helm-case-fold-search'.

- DEL-INPUT: Boolean, when non--nil (default) remove the partial
  minibuffer input from HISTORY is present.

- PERSISTENT-ACTION: A function called with one arg i.e candidate.

- PERSISTENT-HELP: A string to document PERSISTENT-ACTION.

- MODE-LINE: A string or list to display in mode line.
  (See `helm-mode-line-string')

- KEYMAP: A keymap to use in this `helm-comp-read'.
  (the keymap will be shared with history source)

- NAME: The name related to this local source.

- EXEC-WHEN-ONLY-ONE: Bound `helm-execute-action-at-once-if-one'
  to non--nil. (possibles values are t or nil).

- VOLATILE: Use volatile attribute (enabled by default).

- SORT: A predicate to give to `sort' e.g `string-lessp'.

- FC-TRANSFORMER: A `filtered-candidate-transformer' function.

- MARKED-CANDIDATES: If non--nil return candidate or marked candidates as a list.

- ALISTP: (default is non--nil) See `helm-comp-read-get-candidates'.

- CANDIDATES-IN-BUFFER: when non--nil use a source build with
  `helm-candidates-in-buffer' which is much faster.
  Argument VOLATILE have no effect when CANDIDATES-IN-BUFFER is non--nil.

Any prefix args passed during `helm-comp-read' invocation will be recorded
in `helm-current-prefix-arg', otherwise if prefix args were given before
`helm-comp-read' invocation, the value of `current-prefix-arg' will be used.
That's mean you can pass prefix args before or after calling a command
that use `helm-comp-read' See `helm-M-x' for example.

(defvar smooth-scroll-margin 10 "\
Number of lines of visible margin at the top and bottom of a window.
If the point is within these margins, then scrolling will occur
smoothly for `previous-line' at the top of the window, and for
`next-line' at the bottom.

This is very similar in its goal to `scroll-margin'.  However, it
is implemented by activating `smooth-scroll-down' and
`smooth-scroll-up' advise via `defadvice' for `previous-line' and
`next-line' respectively.  As a result it avoids problems
afflicting `scroll-margin', such as a sudden jump and unexpected
highlighting of a region when the mouse is clicked in the margin.

Scrolling only occurs when the point is closer to the window
boundary it is heading for (top or bottom) than the middle of the
window.  This is to intelligently handle the case where the
margins cover the whole buffer (e.g. `smooth-scroll-margin' set
to 5 and `window-height' returning 10 or less).

See also `smooth-scroll-strict-margins'.")

rather than `count-lines' which obtains the number of actual
newlines.  This is because there might be extra newlines hidden
by a mode such as folding-mode, outline-mode, org-mode etc., or
fewer due to very long lines being displayed wrapped when
`truncate-lines' is nil.

However, using `count-screen-lines' can supposedly cause
performance issues in buffers with extremely long lines.  Setting
`cache-long-line-scans' may be able to address this;
alternatively you can set this variable to nil so that the advice
code uses `count-lines', and put up with the fact that sometimes
the point will be allowed to stray into the margin.")
